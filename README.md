   ```
   pip install requests

   pip install pycryptodome
   ```
3. Make a webhook.
4. Copy the webhook url into webhook.txt
5. Run the code or something. (WARNING! This should be done in a vm because the txt file with the login info will be uploaded to anonfiles, so anyone can access the file if they somehow get the url to the file)
