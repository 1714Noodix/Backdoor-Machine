A program made in python for stealing passwords and usernames from Google Chrome/Brave and tokenlog the user's discord.
It will send a message in a webhook, with all the tokens, login info, ip and so on.

   ```
3. Make a webhook.
4. Copy the webhook url into webhook.txt
5. Run the code or something. (WARNING! This should be done in a vm(Virtual Machine) because the txt file with the login info will be uploaded to anonfiles, so anyone can access the file if they somehow get the url to the file)

   ```
2. Make a webhook.
